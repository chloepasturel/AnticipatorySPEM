\section*{Problematic}

Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combination of saccades and smooth eye movements. These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus enabling high-resolution visual detection. When predictive information is available about target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. It is generally assumed that the role of anticipatory eye movements is to limit the behavioral impairment due to eye-to-target position and velocity mismatch.

By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM, as measured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp-motion onset. This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements~\textcite{Montagnini2010}.

%\end{center}

However, such estimate may become particularly challenging in a dynamic context, where the probabilistic contingencies vary in time in an unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the information processing underlying the buildup of aSPEM is linked to an explicit estimate of probabilities is unknown.


\section*{Material and Method}

In order to answer these questions, we have set up an experiment comprising 3 blocks of 200 trials. For each trial, a target makes either to the left or to the right, this direction being drawn from a Bernouilli process. The probability of this process varied in a piecewise-constant (that is, a step function varying between $0$ and $1$), similar to~\textcite{Meyniel13}. The occurence of these switches is itself drawn from a Bernouilli process of probability $p_{switch}=1/40$.

\begin{center} 
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{exp}
\end{center}

We asked subjects to perform two tasks on different days:
%\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0ex}
%\item a <<Bet>>
%\item a <<recording>>
%\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The <<Bet>>}
In this first part, the subjects must simply answer before each trial at the question \textit{ ``How sure are you that the target will go left or right''}. This was performed by adjusting a cursor on the screen using the mouse (see Figure).
\begin{center} 
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{materiel_bet}
\end{center}

\subsection*{<<Recording>>}
Then, we recorded their eye movements as they were tracking the target's motion. Importantly, we used that exact same sequence.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{<<Bet>>}

Example of results obtained during the bet :

Comparison of probabilities bet with respect to the real probability:

    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{p_true--p_parie}
\end{center}


\subsection*{The <<Recording>>}

In order to extract the relevant parameters of the oculomotor responses, we developed new tools based on a best-fitting procedure
of predefined patterns and in particular the typical smooth pursuit velocity profile that was recorded for the aSPEM (Top row). This was applied to each trial individually, and we show below some prototypical example of respectively a neutral, anticipatory positive and anticipatory negative aSPEMs examples (respectively second to bottom rows):

Example of results obtained during the recording overlaid with the results of the ``bet'' experiment :

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{results_enregistrement}
\end{center}

\columnbreak
Let's plot the acceleration of anticipation (slope of aSPEM) as a function of the real probability at every given trial:

\begin{center} 
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{p_true--v_a}
\end{center}

when we omit the first 15 trials after the switches, it gives :

\begin{center} 
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{p_true--v_a_15}
\end{center}

Which give a low, yet positive Spearman coefficient.;

\subsection*{Relating the <<Bet>> to the  <<Recording>>}

We now compare the probability bet during the bet with the acceleration of anticipation %:

(we omit the first 15 trials after the switches) :

\begin{center} 
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{p_parie--v_a_15}
\end{center}

\section*{Conclusions}


\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{0ex}
\item There is a strong correlation between the real probability and the one which is bet,

\item there is a low, yet positive correlation between the strength of anticipation and the probability of the process and that which is bet,

\item we are now developing a Bayesian model of an agent computing an estimate of changing points and of the probability and which should provide a more significant correlation. The parameters of such agents should provide useful to characterise the response of the subjects.

\end{itemize}
